Zharia Tucker: Okay, sorry about that. Yes, okay. So the time is now 8 0, 6, this is our team meeting for September 28, th 2024.

2
00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:12.889
Zharia Tucker: Everyone is here. Cole, Sean, Nasir and Zaria.

3
00:00:13.745 --> 00:00:26.509
Zharia Tucker: We're just gonna run through our meeting minutes and agenda items. So our 1st item is, gonna be just addressing the group communication. The second one is gonna be about the assignment for the milestone one.

4
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.139
Zharia Tucker: and our last meeting agenda will be just a delegation of the task.

5
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.570
Zharia Tucker: So

6
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.690
Zharia Tucker: I'm just gonna pull up some notes that I had

7
00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:51.989
Zharia Tucker: so just about the 1st one, I just wanna make sure. I know this is our 1st official meeting, but I did just wanna make sure that we're all staying active. Just in our communication, Sean. I know you had a mix up with our time, but I do appreciate you coming back and saying something

8
00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:03.490
Zharia Tucker: and being able to join. But that goes for me or any of us. Just make sure that when texts are sent regardless if I send them. I know this week was kind of hard, considering the storm and whatnot

9
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:10.870
Zharia Tucker: but just make sure to just check up in your text messages that I may send, or any other one of us may send.

10
00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.749
Zharia Tucker: I know we agreed. That text messages in zoom, or like a group facetime will be our communication. So just make sure that we're all

11
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.549
Zharia Tucker: checking up. In there. Was there anything that you all wanted to address with that as well?

12
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.990
Zharia Tucker: Hello!

13
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.199
Cole: My fault. It cut out. What did you say?

14
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.769
Zharia Tucker: Oh, I was just asking. I I know I kind of gave a spill. But was there anything else that you all wanted to address?

15
00:01:43.752 --> 00:01:44.360
Cole: No, I'm good.

16
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.429
sean lang: Yeah, I think I'm good on everything.

17
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.300
Zharia Tucker: Okay.

18
00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:53.050
Zharia Tucker: so there's a section

19
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.990
Zharia Tucker: for

20
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.710
Zharia Tucker: like a conclusion. I can. I'll just

21
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.519
Zharia Tucker: put down group agreed.

22
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.189
Zharia Tucker: Please go active.

23
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:30.179
Zharia Tucker: There isn't. There is a section for action items in this communication. I don't believe we really need any unless y'all think otherwise. There's an action items

24
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.150
Zharia Tucker: person responsible and a deadline.

25
00:02:33.428 --> 00:02:40.410
Zharia Tucker: That was just more so, I guess. Just a statement to make before we really opened up the meeting. But was were there any action items that

26
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.950
Zharia Tucker: you all wanted to add any deadlines or someone responsible for it.

27
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.309
Naser Halloum: So are you looking at project meeting guidelines.

28
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.900
Zharia Tucker: Yes, I am.

29
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.929
Naser Halloum: Or a section.

30
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:59.669
Zharia Tucker: It's the 1st section under the minutes. So it says, the agenda discussion, conclusions and action items.

31
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.230
Naser Halloum: Okay.

32
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.990
Zharia Tucker: You probably can't see, but I've already filled out like the agenda item, if it probably didn't populate for you. But I just didn't know if there were any action items for.

33
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.109
Naser Halloum: You can share your screen so we can see what you see now. Right now.

34
00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:20.979
Zharia Tucker: Okay, give me one second because I am on

35
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.349
Zharia Tucker: my ipad, but I can join.

36
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.249
Zharia Tucker: Let me join from my laptop real quick.

37
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.250
Zharia Tucker: Yeah, I'll just. It'll just be 2 of me. Okay, give me one second.

38
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.360
Zharia Tucker: Can anyone find?

39
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.429
Zharia Tucker: Never mind. Never mind.

40
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.010
Zharia Tucker: 1, 2, 8.

41
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.670
Zharia Tucker: See?

42
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.170
Zharia Tucker: Okay? You all can still hear me.

43
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.760
Naser Halloum: Yes.

44
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.300
Zharia Tucker: Okay.

45
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.280
Zharia Tucker: Just making sure.

46
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.900
Cole: Yes.

47
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.229
Zharia Tucker: Okay, let me share my screen.

48
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.654
Zharia Tucker: Okay, so this is what I was referring to.

49
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.549
Zharia Tucker: the action items right here.

50
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.879
Zharia Tucker: If there was anything that you all wanted to add for this.

51
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.400
Naser Halloum: So what do you mean by action? Items

52
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.160
Naser Halloum: like what? What's expected from action items.

53
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.873
Zharia Tucker: I'm assuming for for action items. It would be like if one of our

54
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.919
Zharia Tucker: like, when we delegate our task, an action item could be.

55
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.620
Zharia Tucker: You get something.

56
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:11.419
Zharia Tucker: You get the budget done by tomorrow at 2 o'clock. It would be like that. So the action item would be for you to complete the budget, the person responsible would be you, and then the deadline would be a date or time. For example, just, for example.

57
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:20.839
Zharia Tucker: But obviously, that's what I'm saying. Obviously for this, it was just more so of an open discussion. So I didn't have an action item to put for this agenda item. Unless someone did

58
00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:24.559
Zharia Tucker: it doesn't. I don't see how, but if if so, it's fine.

59
00:05:26.065 --> 00:05:27.010
Cole: No, I don't.

60
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.490
Zharia Tucker: No, okay.

61
00:05:29.155 --> 00:05:32.714
Zharia Tucker: we can move forward. And I'm working off

62
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.119
Zharia Tucker: like 2, 3 devices right now, so we can move forward with the

63
00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:44.300
Zharia Tucker: next agenda item, which was the assignment that is due tomorrow at 1155

64
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.659
Zharia Tucker: I'm just gonna add

65
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:53.540
Zharia Tucker: my name here, but if anyone else wants to present or talk about it. I mean, we can. We'll discuss regardless.

66
00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:00.839
Zharia Tucker: But the discussion. I didn't finish this, but the discussion was to address the components of mile someone, and to make sure

67
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.470
Zharia Tucker: the group

68
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.010
Zharia Tucker: is delegated task

69
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.079
Zharia Tucker: by the end of the meeting.

70
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.500
Zharia Tucker: So going back to

71
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.499
Zharia Tucker: assignment, I'm pulling that up now. There are. There are a lot of different components.

72
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:36.569
Zharia Tucker: so there's a swot analysis, a budget scope and time. Estimate a team contract

73
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:46.450
Zharia Tucker: and just for the professional document. There it needs to be a cover page table of contents and page numbers. I believe that's all for this assignment.

74
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.610
Zharia Tucker: My thoughts

75
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.550
Zharia Tucker: were to obviously work on the team contract together.

76
00:06:55.865 --> 00:07:01.279
Zharia Tucker: We kinda have to just to make sure that we all are collaborating and making sure that we all have the same visual

77
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:07.880
Zharia Tucker: for how we want to work on this. The project, Charter. I also looked at that as well. I don't mind taking on that task

78
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.970
Zharia Tucker: which really leaves the swot analysis

79
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:25.570
Zharia Tucker: and the budget, the swot analysis, the budget, scope and time chart as well as the like other things to cover page table of contents and page numbers.

80
00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:29.769
Zharia Tucker: So I just wanted to know how y'all wanted to delegate.

81
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.650
Cole: I'll do the swot analysis.

82
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.650
Zharia Tucker: Who said that?

83
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.230
Cole: Call.

84
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.310
Zharia Tucker: Okay. Sorry I can't let me change the view again.

85
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.303
Zharia Tucker: Okay, Cole said that so Cole will take on the swot analysis. Okay,

86
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.009
Naser Halloum: I'm doing budget.

87
00:07:52.660 --> 00:08:01.910
Zharia Tucker: Yes, okay, great. So I know not. Sarah asked you once before, like how you feel about budgets and just like

88
00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:10.509
Zharia Tucker: creating those type of charts. I don't mind helping on it as well, but just so we're all kind of doing equal parts. Shawn, do you mind

89
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.490
Zharia Tucker: how how good are you with creating budgets.

90
00:08:14.824 --> 00:08:22.640
sean lang: I mean, I've taken an accounting class. So I should be fine with it. And I was also gonna say, I'd be fine doing the table of contents and the page numbers.

91
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.890
sean lang: Okay, that's we still need to.

92
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.310
Zharia Tucker: Yes, so

93
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:37.052
Zharia Tucker: so Nasir Sean will take on the budget and

94
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.280
Zharia Tucker: There's a document that she's included.

95
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:49.560
Zharia Tucker: Sorry I'm taking notes doing this as well. But there's a doc. There's a document that she included. Sorry, it's under sample document. If you scroll down to page

96
00:08:50.757 --> 00:08:53.549
Zharia Tucker: about 12, I believe.

97
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.750
Zharia Tucker: Yes, about 1212, through 14. There is a

98
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.750
Zharia Tucker: some documents or some charts. I'm not sure how

99
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.679
Zharia Tucker: intricate she wants these.

100
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:15.779
Zharia Tucker: So I would think, whatever you all can produce would be great. It would definitely take some collaboration. And like I said, if if Johnny help on the back end

101
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:22.169
Zharia Tucker: I'll start brainstorming stuff as well. But, Shawn, for this meeting I did want to

102
00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:26.617
Zharia Tucker: just cause I I know you were the one who came up with the

103
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:34.979
Zharia Tucker: the famu uber app. I just wanted to know if you could run through your thought process again

104
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.519
Zharia Tucker: for the app. It would help. I think I believe it would help

105
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.800
Zharia Tucker: coal

106
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.900
Zharia Tucker: complete the swot analysis.

107
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.110
sean lang: Okay.

108
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.330
sean lang: yeah. So basically, the idea was kind of for

109
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:58.690
sean lang: like, a service for ride transportation. But it would be exclusive to like students for that. Go to famu it only like provide service to that area on campus.

110
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.949
sean lang: and that's pretty much the base idea I had.

111
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.819
sean lang: I think there were other

112
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:09.849
sean lang: like other services that we could integrate. That Uber doesn't currently have that. I put in the last document.

113
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.200
sean lang: So I can go back and

114
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.190
sean lang: pull that for you guys.

115
00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.621
Zharia Tucker: Okay, yeah, if you could share that to our chat or

116
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.429
Zharia Tucker: with Cole, that will be great

117
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.160
Zharia Tucker: like, I said, I just think it will help all of us

118
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:33.429
Zharia Tucker: just reiterate, like what we're really doing. But I know that swot analysis. He's just gonna need those fine details.

119
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.299
Zharia Tucker: so I'll go ahead and put in our

120
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.829
Zharia Tucker: action items.

121
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.038
Zharia Tucker: What is it? The project, Charter? And there's another thing I'm not sure if y'all realize

122
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.259
Zharia Tucker: at the bottom of.

123
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.500
Zharia Tucker: not the bottom.

124
00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:02.109
Zharia Tucker: the the documents, the requirements for this document, the assignment she has that for the Project charter, I believe it's called.

125
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.500
Zharia Tucker: Yes, the project, Charter, that I'm working on. It needs to be signed by her.

126
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:15.760
Zharia Tucker: So she suggested that we submit it pretty early, which obviously is 8 o'clock the night before, but she wanted us to submit it pretty early.

127
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:25.480
Zharia Tucker: so that that way, if she had any changes that we'd be able to work on that she also put that we will not receive credit if it's not signed. So

128
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:32.810
Zharia Tucker: my thought process and anyone can change the time. Just for what y'all need was to try to have everything done

129
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.759
Zharia Tucker: tomorrow around like 5 to 6 Pm.

130
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.230
Zharia Tucker: I don't.

131
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:50.460
Zharia Tucker: I would think that would maybe give her some time to look at it and make changes if necessary. But is that going to be a problem for anyone? If it is, that's fine. I just wanna be sure

132
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:57.010
Zharia Tucker: that we're trying to give her ample time to look at it? Or did y'all want to make it do earlier like, what are y'all thinking.

133
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.889
Cole: 5 to 6 is good for me.

134
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.520
sean lang: Yeah, that's good for me as well.

135
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.140
Naser Halloum: Yep.

136
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.390
Zharia Tucker: Fact, I just.

137
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.120
Naser Halloum: For me.

138
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.310
Zharia Tucker: It's between 5 to 6 pm.

139
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.930
Zharia Tucker: Oh, wait, hold on.

140
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:16.421
Zharia Tucker: Doesn't make any sense. Okay, so I'm gonna put that on. I just wanted I wanted to ask that now, because I see there's a

141
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.839
Zharia Tucker: There's a deadline section.

142
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.450
Zharia Tucker: So we have the project charter.

143
00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.160
Zharia Tucker: and we'll just wanna put this for.

144
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.187
Zharia Tucker: Okay. What else? It was the swat.

145
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.429
Zharia Tucker: Cole, you said you're taking on the Swat.

146
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.330
Cole: Yes.

147
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.999
Zharia Tucker: Jeez call what's her last name?

148
00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.550
Cole: Holloman, HOLL. OMAM.

149
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.970
Zharia Tucker: I know y'all somebody has somewhere

150
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.319
Zharia Tucker: last name.

151
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.370
Zharia Tucker: Let's see.

152
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.489
Zharia Tucker: And then more okay, and then we can put the

153
00:13:13.579 --> 00:13:14.389
Zharia Tucker: and

154
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.060
Zharia Tucker: I don't see where I can add

155
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.729
Zharia Tucker: another one. But just keep in mind.

156
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.319
Zharia Tucker: I know, I said. I'll I'll can do the cover, page. But.

157
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.550
Zharia Tucker: Sean.

158
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:35.850
Zharia Tucker: if you could also get the well. You can't really put in the table of contents or page numbers without, so that'll probably be the last thing done.

159
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.840
sean lang: Yeah.

160
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.349
Zharia Tucker: Just keep that in mind as you're working through everything.

161
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.160
sean lang: Okay.

162
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.520
Zharia Tucker: Yeah.

163
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.585
Zharia Tucker: Okay.

164
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:50.975
Zharia Tucker: Sorry

165
00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.719
Zharia Tucker: at 6 pm.

166
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.650
Zharia Tucker: okay, those were really, just my 2.

167
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.844
Zharia Tucker: Well, you know, I guess I can put the last meeting agenda as

168
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.200
Zharia Tucker: oh.

169
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.280
Zharia Tucker: so there is also a team contract

170
00:14:20.457 --> 00:14:33.579
Zharia Tucker: and if y'all had, if y'all have had the chance to look at it, sorry it's really just us talking and making sure that we're aligning on the same thing. So I did just want to go ahead and do that while we're all on the phone with one another.

171
00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:42.000
Zharia Tucker: But if you're not able to pull it up, then I can go ahead and just read off on it. And like, I said, I'm still taking notes on

172
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:54.889
Zharia Tucker: things that are being said. So the 1st question for the project team contract is about our goals. So the questions are, What are our goals? What are our team goals for this project? And what do we want to accomplish?

173
00:14:56.612 --> 00:15:00.600
Cole: To create a way for famu students to travel around campus safely.

174
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.110
Zharia Tucker: Okay.

175
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:14.189
Zharia Tucker: And I know Shawn. Yeah, that was Sean who mentioned earlier something that was exclusive as well. I did like that word. So I wanted to make a note of that.

176
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.359
Zharia Tucker: just like an exclusive transportation to famu students.

177
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.620
sean lang: Yeah.

178
00:15:23.202 --> 00:15:28.360
Zharia Tucker: The next question is, what do we want to accomplish? I think we already answered that.

179
00:15:29.041 --> 00:15:39.879
Zharia Tucker: I think another thing that could be mentioned was providing students with jobs around campus if we just wanted to make it like with

180
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.539
Zharia Tucker: literally within the famu community.

181
00:15:43.158 --> 00:15:49.050
Zharia Tucker: type of thing. And I would think, for that point. A weakness or a threat call

182
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.240
Zharia Tucker: would just be the safety of students driving students.

183
00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.170
Zharia Tucker: If that makes sense.

184
00:15:59.674 --> 00:16:01.260
Cole: I understand what you're saying, yeah.

185
00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.240
sean lang: You can go.

186
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:12.409
Zharia Tucker: Yes, I would just we could all just keep that in mind. But definitely for the swat. We we may have to throw that in somewhere, because that may be a concern for

187
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.600
Zharia Tucker: legal reasons for the school. That could be a threat, a legal threat for the school?

188
00:16:19.174 --> 00:16:24.660
Zharia Tucker: And then the last question for the goals is, what skills do we want to develop or refine

189
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.300
Zharia Tucker: starting.

190
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.420
sean lang: Is that like, would that just be generally or like just with this kind of topic?

191
00:16:40.092 --> 00:16:42.440
Zharia Tucker: I believe it's

192
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.570
Zharia Tucker: hmm.

193
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.340
Zharia Tucker: I I took it as.

194
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.370
Naser Halloum: Generally, I think.

195
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.630
Zharia Tucker: I'm sorry. What did you say now, sir?

196
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.719
Naser Halloum: I think it's in general. It's talking about

197
00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.770
Naser Halloum: engineering.

198
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:06.209
Zharia Tucker: Yeah, I think it's in general, too, like outside of the project. What do we personally, as a group.

199
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:12.690
Zharia Tucker: want to develop or refine? I was the only one that I could really think of was like app development.

200
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.399
Zharia Tucker: I mean, it would kind of help us understand the ins and outs of it.

201
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.390
Zharia Tucker: I don't. I know we're not literally making one, but.

202
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.149
sean lang: I would agree, I would definitely say that, and also

203
00:17:29.693 --> 00:17:35.160
sean lang: for me, I'd say, like knowing how to accurately measure how long like a certain task would take.

204
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.240
sean lang: or I guess, just like time management skills.

205
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.260
Zharia Tucker: I cannot spell today. Okay, how to measure. Let's see.

206
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.260
Zharia Tucker: So app development how to.

207
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.519
Zharia Tucker: And you said, that could be time management. Okay.

208
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:15.169
Zharia Tucker: the next question, if there's no more responses for that, one is for our expectations. What do we expect of one another in regard to attendance at meetings. Participation.

209
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.849
Zharia Tucker: frequency of communication, the quality of work, etc.

210
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:31.720
Cole: I say, in terms of like communicating like at least twice a week, because we have classes twice a week on Wednesday. So at the least twice.

211
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.830
Zharia Tucker: Okay, meet meets twice a week, I would say,

212
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.169
Zharia Tucker: again. Just going back to the 1st point. Just timeliness communication.

213
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:56.640
Zharia Tucker: and just like be on time. I guess that's timeliness. But just make sure that we're meeting deadlines that we set for one another.

214
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.309
Zharia Tucker: Is there anything else anybody else wanted to add, if not, it's okay.

215
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.009
Zharia Tucker: No, okay.

216
00:19:11.356 --> 00:19:19.180
Zharia Tucker: Moving on to the next one is policies and procedures. What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations.

217
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.690
Zharia Tucker: I feel like the one of the rules that we've all spoke on just

218
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.559
Zharia Tucker: so far in us. Getting

219
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.738
Zharia Tucker: like having our meetings is

220
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.600
Zharia Tucker: communicating. Make make sure that you communicate with one another.

221
00:19:45.752 --> 00:19:48.850
Zharia Tucker: I would say. Another one is to

222
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.200
Zharia Tucker: maintain integrity

223
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.420
Zharia Tucker: in our work.

224
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.940
Zharia Tucker: Make sure, like our work is our own.

225
00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.719
Zharia Tucker: but that we're collaborating with each other on it.

226
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.049
Zharia Tucker: Is there anything.

227
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.190
sean lang: We could also say, maybe just sticking to like the

228
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:14.120
sean lang: the company mission statement kind of like that goes along with the charter

229
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.649
sean lang: like basically just not coming up with anything too far from the actual idea.

230
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.320
Zharia Tucker: Okay, stick to the company mission statement.

231
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.390
Zharia Tucker: Okay?

232
00:20:28.212 --> 00:20:29.630
Zharia Tucker: Any other ones?

233
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.510
Zharia Tucker: Okay, no problem.

234
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.390
Zharia Tucker: And the last question

235
00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:48.880
Zharia Tucker: is about consequences. So how will we address non-performance in regard to these goals, expectations.

236
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.920
Zharia Tucker: policies, and procedures.

237
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.500
Naser Halloum: Let the instructor

238
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.440
Naser Halloum: know about what happened.

239
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.630
Naser Halloum: If something happens.

240
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.860
Zharia Tucker: Okay.

241
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.930
Zharia Tucker: okay.

242
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.189
Zharia Tucker: reach out to the professor. And I believe,

243
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.459
Zharia Tucker: On this assignment there is

244
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.860
Zharia Tucker: the Cis 4, 3, 0 1 project overview.

245
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:29.020
Zharia Tucker: She talked about this before, but hopefully we won't do this. But there is a section about removing a teammate team member.

246
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.810
Zharia Tucker: So I'm sure there's the process

247
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:38.090
Zharia Tucker: and how to do all of that there, if necessary. But was there any other consequence? I was thinking

248
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.720
Zharia Tucker: before

249
00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:44.350
Zharia Tucker: talking with the Professor to meet with that person first.st

250
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.830
Naser Halloum: Yeah, and try to solve the issue on our own.

251
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.350
sean lang: Brew.

252
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.690
Zharia Tucker: Right. Yes.

253
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.299
Zharia Tucker: and then, like, I said, if necessary, hope hopefully not. Probably not. But

254
00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.299
Zharia Tucker: that's always another way that we can go as a consequence.

255
00:22:02.501 --> 00:22:05.149
Zharia Tucker: I do believe that that was

256
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.140
Zharia Tucker: all that work that I wanted to meet about for the agenda

257
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.350
Zharia Tucker: again for this team contract. Since it was.

258
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.869
Zharia Tucker: I'm just. I'll just say that the presenter was everyone.

259
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.760
Zharia Tucker: I feel like the presenter was everyone. I don't. I don't really know what she wants with the presenter.

260
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.230
Naser Halloum: I think you should type our names. If you want to say everyone.

261
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.830
Zharia Tucker: For everyone. Okay.

262
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.959
Zharia Tucker: SHOL LOMA, N. Co.

263
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.880
Cole: Yes.

264
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.560
Zharia Tucker: Okay.

265
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.300
Zharia Tucker: let's see

266
00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.010
Zharia Tucker: again for

267
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.259
Zharia Tucker: the action items. I don't think there's much that we

268
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.489
Zharia Tucker: could put, since it was just another

269
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:14.039
Zharia Tucker: open discussion. But if there are any ideas for control there, I'm definitely open to putting them down for us.

270
00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:24.110
Zharia Tucker: We didn't have any observers. We didn't have any other resources or special notes to give.

271
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.540
Zharia Tucker: This is really just a document. I just wanted to share out everything but

272
00:23:33.017 --> 00:23:37.329
Zharia Tucker: there should be an official note taker. The meeting should be added to a repository.

273
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.400
Zharia Tucker: The facilitators I need to add that then.

274
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.250
Zharia Tucker: Okay.

275
00:23:46.421 --> 00:23:51.540
Zharia Tucker: and there is a note that she'll request to be present in at least 2 to 3.

276
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:59.219
Zharia Tucker: Obviously we're not there at that point yet, but I do believe that's all for this project meetings, guideline document. Is there anything else that

277
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:07.319
Zharia Tucker: you all? Let me add, y'all. But is there anything else that anyone wanted to address while we are still meeting.

278
00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.660
